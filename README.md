# Solidity Demo Project

Personal project to test out [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io).

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

## Project setup

Project is bootstraped with [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/overview) development environment.

```
npm install -g truffle
```

[Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/docs/ganache/overview) is used as a personal blockchain for Ethereum development, where you can deploy contracts, develop your applications, and run tests.


To create an empty project setup without any existing smart contracts, use
```
truffle init
```

To create new contracts, create a new `*.sol` file inside the `contracts/` folder.

## Project deployment

To generate Ethereum accounts to test/develop your smart contract, use:

```
truffle develop
```

Then open Ganache GUI and create new workspace. In settings/accounts copy the mnemonic generated by Truffle. Also make sure you are on the same Port in your Ganache GUI that Truffle is using.

You should see the same accounts in your console as in Ganache.

To compile your smart contract, use
```
truffle compile
```
or just `compile` if you're still running `truffle develop` command.

Once your contract is compiled, you need to migrate it to Ganache network. [Migrations](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations) are JavaScript files that help you deploy contracts to the Ethereum network. Once you setup your migration file, run `migrate` command in your console. 

If everything was set up alright, your contract should be deployed on Ganache network, which you can see in Ganache GUI.
